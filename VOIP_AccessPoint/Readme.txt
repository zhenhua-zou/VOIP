This code is an implementation of the access point based on the multi-threaded Linux socket programming. 
We mimic the session initial protocol, while the RTP protocol is not implemented. 
The raw control and the voice data are sent/received from the serial port, which is connected to the CC1010 chip. 

The implementation of the hand-held device is left to one of my colleagues.
